==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we 
captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments 
have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two 
sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled 
in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, 
which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body 
acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a 
filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating 
variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record of the original data it was provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the original feature vector and operations performed for the resultant tidy data set.

- 'features.txt': List of all features in the data set.  The feature list is the result of subsetting the original data to only contain measurements 
   taken on the mean and standard deviation.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Contains the list of names for the activities measured in the experiment.  The activities were originally identified
   by number.  An operation was performed on the data to replace the number identification with a descriptive name of the activity performed by the subjects.

- 'data.txt': The original data was comprised of four files that were combined and operated on to produce data.txt:

	- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

	- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

	- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

	- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

   To achieve the required tidy data set, both the X and y files were combined, for their respective sets (X_train was combined with y_train, and X_test with y_test), 
   to label the identify each measurement with its corresponding activity.  Once the test and training data were labeled by activity both of these files were 
   then combined.  The result was subsetted so only measurements taken on the mean and standard deviation were retained in the data.  The final operation on the data
   took the mean of the remaining variables for each subject. All variable names were changed to lowercase and extraneous punctuation removed per best practices 
   for tidy data.  

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. 
Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
